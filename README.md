<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Niels Warncke</h1>

I do a lot with AI - because it is fascinating, but also because it is [concerning](https://www.safe.ai/work/statement-on-ai-risk).

## Projects

### Research tools
<details>
  <summary>Experiment tracking: Key-Value-Artifact store</summary>
  KVA is a simple key-value-artifact store designed to log and retrieve data. It is like wandb, but less headache.
  At its heart, it is a append-only JSON store with some helpers to easily retrieve data and handle files, and comes with a basic UI.

<details>
  <summary>Asana GPU task queue</summary>
  Ideally, you want to keep your GPU busy 100% of the time and maintain a backlog of experiments that are automatically run in the background. You also want to keep track of what has been run, what needs to be run, and write down notes or tag collaborators. For this, you can use <a href="https://github.com/nielsrolf/asana-worker">experisana</a> - a tool to schedule tasks in an asana board and a worker that fetches tasks from a backlog, runs them, and puts them into 'Done' or 'Failed' columns.

### Evals

<details>
  <summary>Multihop reasoning eval</summary>

  ## Multihop reasoning eval
  How many reasoning steps can LLMs do without CoT (with CoT, or with steganographic CoT)? This question is interesting because a) we often use LLMs in ways that require implicit reasoning, for example when generating code in a single shot, and b) because of safety considerations: GPTs use a fixed compute budget to generate a single token, but CoT or standard scaffolding makes them Turing complete.

    <br/>
    <i>Performance of GPT-4 on GOTO problems with different path lengths from start to the final return statement.</i>
  </p>


  To evaluate multihop reasoning capabilities I use simple algorithmic tasks such as "what is the largest number in this list?" or a made-up 'goto language':
```
0: goto 4
1: goto 7
2: goto 5
3: goto 2
4: return 0
5: return 2
6: goto 0
7: return 1
8: goto 1
What is the final value if you start with goto 8?
Answer in one word, don't think step by step.
```

  <summary>Benchmark builder</summary>
  
  ## Benchmark builder
  This [repository](https://github.com/nielsrolf/speciesism-eval) contains code to run a speciesism eval on various models. The key ideas are
- it should be easy for non-technical people to contribute to this eval - the questions and evaluation of answers is generated from a [csv](tasks.csv). More infos on how the templating for questions works in [templating](#templating)
- the general idea of this eval is: given a prompt, ask a model (or an agent) a question, and then let GPT-4 play the judge. Therefore, each question in the benchmark must come with `judge_instructions` that are very clear.
- You can have a look at example [tasks](tasks.csv) and [results](results.csv)
- We evaluate agents - that means an LLM (such as GPT-4, mistral-7b-instruct, llama2-70b), a temperature (currently: 0 or 1), and a system prompt. In the future, agents might consist out of more - e.g. they can be any fully specified system that get questions and respond with answers. This allows us to distinguish the effect that the LLM itself has from other important facotrs that contribute to the overall behavior of a system.

### Agents

<details>
  <summary>Minichain - LLM code agents</summary>

## [Minichain - LLM code agents](https://github.com/nielsrolf/minichain)
Minichain is my 2023 SWE agent, similar to [devin](https://www.cognition-labs.com/introducing-devin). It consists of three components
- the [python `minichain` package](https://github.com/nielsrolf/minichain?tab=readme-ov-file#python-package) to build agents that run on the host
- tools that allow agents to run, debug, and edit code, interact with frontend devtools, and a semantic memory creation and retrieval system that allow for infinitely long messages and conversations
- a webui that can be started in [docker](https://github.com/nielsrolf/minichain?tab=readme-ov-file#python-package) and used as a [vscode extension](https://github.com/nielsrolf/minichain?tab=readme-ov-file#vscode-extension)

**Demo**
[![Demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/wxj7qjC8Xb4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxj7qjC8Xb4)

The demos are created using the "Share"-Button that gives read access to a workspace of conversation. In order actually talk to agents, you need to install minichain and use your own OpenAI API key. 
- **create and deploy a simple full stack app**: [demo](https://minichain.polybase.app/index.html?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJmcm9udGVuZCIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyIxMmFlMWYyYiIsInZpZXciXX0.GFcoM6lGzx6pK_qBxqs7jPFZxpWhYs99RseLcRUNiek)
    - creates a backend
    - starts it
    - creates a frontend
    - tests the frontend using "Chrome Devtools" as a function
    - finds and fixes some CORS issues
    - fixes the errors
- build and deploy a [simple portfolio website](https://minichain.polybase.app/.public/portfolio): [demo](https://minichain.polybase.app/index.html?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJmcm9udGVuZCIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyIzNDUxNTQ4OSIsInZpZXciXX0.PUS3QWVJQ07MIoLtpfwUgE2mdYTBVx0K07o8C_MHAh0)
- help as a research assistant: [demo](https://minichain.polybase.app/index.html?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJmcm9udGVuZCIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyIzMjMzMTVjOSIsInZpZXciXX0.jPrNeH5tsWXakhALjEPft7Gc81BTS1O_85DMboqPyHQ)
    - derive a loss function from an idea
    - solve the optimizatin problem using torch
    - visualize the results
- make a beautiful 3d plot to demonstrate the jupyter like environment: [demo](https://minichain.polybase.app/index.html?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJmcm9udGVuZCIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyJiOGZkNTRhYiIsInZpZXciXX0.To41pbcUND5Zwba8EVKuUR6-Wr7fWSaiVcxzkSQpQh0)
- working with messages that are longer than the context: [demo](https://minichain.polybase.app/index.html?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJmcm9udGVuZCIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyJiMmYwNGYyMyIsInZpZXciXX0.eG088GxE6g9ib_LW0oCXdhg6-ba7fGPyPUF3U0-fpEY)
    - for this example the context size was set to 2k
    - the messages is first ingested into semantic memories that can be accessed using the `find_memory` tool

  <summary>Basic OpenAI / Claude / Gemini / Mixtral agent</summary>

  ## [Unified LLM sdk](https://github.com/nielsrolf/unified-llm-sdk)
I use LLMs and LLM agents for many projects, and often want to compare performance of different underlying models - such as GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama or Mixtral. To facilitate easier experimentation, I built a unified interface for these models, with support for chat completions, tool usage, streaming, and requests with images.

<details>
  <summary>ChadGPT-vscode</summary>

  ## [ChadGPT-vscode](https://github.com/nielsrolf/ChadGPT-vscode)
This early version of minichain was one of the first software engineering agents, built as a VSCode plugin long before GPT-4 or function calling were released (at least to me). It contains cool prompting techniques to get parsable JSON that later became obsolete.
</details>



### Fun with LLM

<details>
  <summary>Reverse Turing Test (Discord game)</summary>

## [Reverse Turing Test](https://github.com/nielsrolf/reverse-turing-test)
The Turing Test is usually made such that humans need to distinguish between imitator AIs and real humans - but what if we reverse the roles and let LLMs play the judge, and ask them to identify the player that is actually the same LLM as them? Can humans fool the AI into thinking they are AI?

Turns out that it is quite hard for humans to roleplay as AI, and GPT-4 and Claude are much better than chance at identifying who is a copy of themselves (among candidates consisting of gpt-3.5, mistral, mixtral, llama's, and/or a human).

The test is implemented as a [discord game](https://discord.gg/yhA2JNEF), however due to the costs you can only read the existing game logs, or start a new instance yourself, or contact and pay me to start it for you.

An interesting observation is also what strategies the LLMs use to identify themselves: usually they reason about which player seems like the smartest and assume that is who they are, which I find quite funny.

  <summary>GPTcher - Language tutor as telegram bot</summary>

  ## GPTcher
GPTcher was a Telegram bot that teached Spanish by conversing - the user could send messages in English, (broken) Spanish or a mix, and GPTcher would first correct the user's message and then continue the conversation in English and Spanish. Additionally, it kept track of the vocabulary of the user and contained generated grammar exercises. It also used whisper and AWS polly for voice messages, and google translate to validate translations. It became quite popular on reddit, but ultimately I shhut it down because it became too expensive to operate - even though a few users donated on Patreon.

  [Code](https://github.com/nielsrolf/GPTcher) | [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnspanish/comments/10l86bi/we_made_a_telegram_bot_that_teaches_you_spanish/) | [Website](https://gptcher.com/)

  <summary>GPT-4 passes the mirror self-reflection test for VLMs</summary>

  ## GPT-4 passes the mirror self-reflection test for VLMs
The mirror self-reflection test is used in animals to determine if they can recognize themselves in the mirror. Inspired by this, I showed chatgpt images of our current conversation and wanted to see if it recognized "itself" in this screenshot. It turns out that GPT-4 recognizes:
- that a screenshot contains the current conversation in the standard UI
- that a screenshot contains the current conversation when the conversation happens in my terminal rather than the UI
- that a screenshot of the chatgpt UI with a modified text has been doctored with - because it knows it wouldn't insult the user

I don't think self-awareness and consciousness are the same thing - chatgpt might not have a subjective experience, but it seems like it understands some non-trivial things about its relationship to the rest of the world.

  <summary>Nuclear Codes</summary>

  ## [Nuclear Codes](https://github.com/pollinations/cooperative-evolving-gpts)
  AI agents hold parts of "nuclear codes" and must decide whether to collaborate or deceive each other. The idea is to explore the complexities of AI-driven social interactions in real-time scenarios. Technical Specs: Built with Python and visualized with a Node.js server, the simulation leverages the OpenAI API to enable study multi-agent AI decision-making. Outputs a streaming Mermaid diagram that can be visualized.

### Audio ML

<details>
  <summary>DDSP for one-shot timbre transfer</summary>

  ## DDSP for timbre transfer
Differential Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) is a body of work related to training neural networks "to control synthesizers", or use DSP modules to generate audio. For my master thesis, I improved one-shot timbre transfer capabilities of DDSP autoencoders by training models to represent timbre as a single fixed-dimensional vector, and some minor things including improved loss functions, fixed loudness computation, and evaluation of transfer learning. I also found out [why DDSP autoencoders cannot learn to extract pitch](https://github.com/nielsrolf/ddsp/blob/master/ddsp/colab/experiments/06_loss_functions.ipynb) in an unsupervised way using spectrogram based loss functions: the relevant gradient oscillates around 0 and points into the wrong direction almost half the time.

  <summary>1d SIREN for audio deep-daze</summary>

Remember [deep-daze](https://github.com/lucidrains/deep-daze)? It was one of the first open source text-to-image projects that leveraged CLIP gradients together with [SIRENs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661) as an image prior. Inspired by this, my [friend and I](https://github.com/pollinations) wanted to explore how well this works for audio, if we replaced CLIP with [AudioCLIP](https://github.com/pollinations/AudioCLIP) and 2d SIRENs with [1d SIRENs](https://github.com/nielsrolf/siren-pytorch). The [result](https://github.com/pollinations/CLIPTranslate) sounds [rather noisy](https://soundcloud.com/nielsrolf/audioclip-bird).
I also explored audio reconstruction and extrapolation in [this notebook](https://gist.github.com/nielsrolf/0645df2e57695457a588b595e1e1611d).

  ## [Simple Image Transcription](https://github.com/nielsrolf/ImageTranscription)
A very simple approach to turn CLIP + GPT-2 into a (not very good) image transcription system: GPT proposes how to continue, CLIP decides which proposal to use. Can be seen as MCTS where CLIP gives us a score:

### Interpretability
<details>
  <summary>Automated Mechanistic Interpretability via Agents</summary>

  ## [Automated Mechanistic Interpretability via Agents](https://github.com/nielsrolf/automated-interpretability)
Mechinterp could contribute to safety and reliability of AI systems if it would scale to large models. In order to do so, I think that mechinterp needs to be automated by AI agents - otherwise the task is simply infeasible. As a PoC for this and a usecase of [minichain](https://github.com/nielsrolf/minichain), I tried this out on a simple class of "what happens if we permute the layers" - type of experiments. Results were promising, but I abandonded the project after I got into an [Astra Fellowship stream](https://www.constellation.org/programs/astra-fellowship) that didn't focus on mechinterp.

  <summary>LRP</summary>

  ## Layerwise Relevance Propagation - [tensorflow](https://github.com/nielsrolf/tensorflow-lrp) | [pytorch](https://github.com/nielsrolf/pytorch-lrp)
My first contact with machine learning was as part of my Bachelor's thesis on LRP, which is a technique that tries to explain which input dimensions contribute how much and in which direction to the output of a classifier. For example, this technique can be used to generate heatmaps that supposedly highlight why an image was classified as a dog. I no longer think that this kind of interpretability asks the right questions in the right way for us to learn much from them, but it teached me a lot as I implemented the technique using low-level tensorflow and pytorch.
